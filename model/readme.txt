This System Dynamics deer model is based on the model documented in:
Breierova, L. 1997. Generic structures: Overshoot and collapse. Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA: Massachusetts Institute of Technology,[online],

It was recreated in Stella Architect and adapted slightly for use in the ESD learning tool for the simulation exercises.
